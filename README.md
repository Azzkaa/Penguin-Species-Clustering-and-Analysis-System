# Penguin-Species-Clustering-and-Analysis-System

This project focuses on implementing various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering, to classify and analyze penguin species based on their physical attributes. The system utilizes data preprocessing techniques, dimensionality reduction through PCA, and evaluation metrics like silhouette scores to determine the most effective clustering model. Visualizations are used to show the clusters and the distribution of species, providing insights into the dataset's structure.
